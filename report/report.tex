% Title block - Page 0

% Cover page. Clearly indicate the names of the team members.
% Also provide a table comparing the given specs and achieved spec (remember
% this is for the NON-BONUS part of the project only). You also need to provide
% us a percentage-wise break down of area consumed by different sections of
% bias circuit (VNMOS-bias, VPMOS-bias & bias generator circuit) as compared to
% your core circuit area (refer to Figure 3). For area calculation, use
% AMOS = W * L. Also include the area of resistors in your design. Assume that
% the sheet resistance is 5.5 kohm/sq and the minimum length of resistor is
% 1 um

% Design Outline - Page 1

% Outline of your design. How did you approach this problem? What are some of
% your key design choices? Flow charts and graphs of how the trade-offs are
% connected provide the best clarity in explaining (we'll show some examples in
% class). Half of the grading (i.e. 25 Points) is related to Design Flow,
% Insight and Optimization Strategy. The clarity of your discussion and the
% insight you give, starting on Page 1, is a major factor in doing well for
% these 25 Points.

% Design Schematic - Page 2

% Schematic diagram of your final design, with component values (i.e. W, L
% values etc.), node voltages and bias currents (from SPICE .op simulation)
% clearly labeled (Spend time to make this schematic complete, readable, and
% clear!). Show component values right next to the components, and currents next
% to the branches (i.e., absolutely, positively do not make us refer to a
% look-up table!). Annotate all transistors with their drain current, gate
% overdrive VOV (from SPICE .op simulation) and W/L.

% Calculation of Key Design Parameters - Page 3-6

% Calculation of key design parameters, such as transconductances, bias
% currents, etc. This is the most important section of your report for giving
% critical discussion! Compare the most relevant hand calculated values with
% final SPICE values in a table and discuss discrepancies (percentage
% differences will be clear, you need to show you understand them). Make sure to
% include the total power dissipation of your design (calculated value and SPICE
% result). The lowest power designs will not automatically score the highest
% grades. The methodology you used to justify your design choices and component
% values is far more important (see section on point distribution below).

% Bode Diagrams - Page 7

% Simulated Bode Plots of A(jw), magnitude and phase. Clearly annotate the
% achieved gain and bandwidth. Annotate your hand-calculated values in the same
% plots, noting any specific features of interest (either from the results
% themselves or based on what you've learned in hand calculations or scripting
% the design). Plots must be annotated with meaningful comments/observations.

% Bonus Problem - Appendix II - 5pg max

% If you attempt the bonus problem, describe the limitations of the original
% circuit and your proposed changes to the architecture of this circuit. Draw a
% schematic diagram of your final design with new architecture (follow
% instructions similar to those for page 2) and explain how it helps you achieve
% the new bonus specs. Include the simulated bode plots of A(jw), magnitude and
% phase, annotating the new gain and bandwidth you achieved. On the final page,
% include a table comparing the given specs, the achieved specs using given
% architecture, and the achieved specs for your new architecture.
